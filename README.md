# Goldbach Conjecture
A Study on one of the Oldest and Best-known Unsolved Problems in all of Mathematics

## Description

The goal of this project is to study Goldbach's conjecture for integer pairs greater than 4 x 10^18, with the help of the C Language and the GNU Multi-Precision Library.
The conjecture states that each pair number greater than 2 can be expressed by the sum of two prime numbers.
Our implementation was able to confirm Goldbach's statement for the range of values tested.
